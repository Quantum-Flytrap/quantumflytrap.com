Always wanted to learn the basics of quantum mechanics?

Well, now you can - over a weekend, or on a two-week at-your-pace basis.

No matter if you are for pure curiosity, to understand a reference of Ricky and Morty, or be one of the first to get a job at quantum computing. Learn it before quantum computing becomes mainstream!

## [ENTROLL!](https://forms.gle/cfHgXTNwhuDkycgJA) only ̶$̶2̶0̶0̶  $99

What’s covered:

- Quantum states of light - what is a photon?
- Quantum superposition (a particle being in a few places at once)
- Quantum entanglement (“spooky action at a distance”)
- Quantum measurement
- How to use light for quantum cryptography and computing
- Many-world interpretation

Only in this course:

- No need of previous STEM background
- Interactive exercises with a real simulation (it’s a workshop)
- Recreate famous experiments with a drag&drop interface, no maths (computers are for computing, you do the interesting part!)
- Quantum “LEGO bricks” - you can create experiments without
- Exclusive Discord channel in which you can ask any question about quantum mechanics (even NOT covered in the course)

Policy:

- If the 100% refund; if it didn’t meet your expectations, your money is back, unconditionally
- Diploma for who finished the course

If you want to participate [sign up here](https://forms.gle/cfHgXTNwhuDkycgJA). There is only a limited number of places we can offer at this point, so it works on a “first come, first served” basis. The number of discount places is limited.

Piotr Migdał, obtained his PhD in quantum optics theory in ICFO (in 2012 top 1st worldwide institute in physics, [as measured by high-impact papers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/08/07/83205/the-worlds-best-and-worst-scientific-institutions-ranked-by-discipline/)).
After finishing his doctoral studies, he became a consultant in machine learning & deep learning, giving workshops at companies such as Intel, Boston Consulting Group and Samsung Research.

His approach of simple, visual explanations attract people from diverse backgrounds. He succeeded in teaching [quantum mechanics for high-school students](https://p.migdal.pl/2016/08/15/quantum-mechanics-for-high-school-students.html) and AI for anyone with even a simple knowledge of Python ([Learning Deep Learning with Keras](https://p.migdal.pl/2017/04/30/teaching-deep-learning.html)).
