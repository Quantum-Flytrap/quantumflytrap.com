Always wanted to learn the basics of quantum mechanics?
Well, now you can - over a weekend, or on a two-week at-your-pace basis.

No matter if you are for pure curiosity, to understand a reference of Ricky and Morty, or be one of the first to get a job at quantum computing. Learn it before quantum computing 

SIGN UP
--$200-- $99

What’s covered:

* Quantum states of light - what is a photon?
* Quantum superposition (a particle being in a few places at once)
* Quantum entanglement (“spooky action at a distance”)
* Quantum measurement
* How to use light for quantum cryptography and computing
* Many-world interpretation

Only in this course:

* No need of previous STEM background
* Interactive exercises with a real simulation (it’s a workshop)
* Recreate famous experiments with a drag&drop interface, no maths (computers are for computing, you do the interesting part!)
* Quantum “LEGO bricks” - you can create experiments without
* Exclusive Discord channel in which you can ask any question about quantum mechanics (even NOT covered in the course)

Policy:

* If the 100% refund; if it didn’t meet your expectations, your money is back, unconditionally
* Diploma for who finished the course
