## 

Always wanted to learn the basics of quantum mechanics?
Sign up for our upcoming Quantum Course and learn the basics of quantum mechanics over a weekend, or on a two-week at-your-pace basis.

No matter if for pure curiosity, to understand a reference from Rick and Morty, or to be among the first ones to get a job at quantum computing. 

## Early Bird: $̶2̶0̶0̶ $99
## [ENTROLL](https://forms.gle/cfHgXTNwhuDkycgJA)

What you will learn:

- Quantum states of light - what is a photon?
- Quantum superposition (a particle being in a few places at once)
- Quantum entanglement (Einstein’s “spooky action at a distance”)
- Quantum measurement
- How to use light for quantum cryptography and computing
- Quantum computing logic gates
- Qubits 
- Many-world interpretation

Only in this course:

- No need of previous STEM background
- Hands-on interactive exercises with a real simulation (it’s a workshop)
- Recreate famous experiments with a drag & drop interface 
- Computing left for computers, you do the interesting part!
- Quantum “LEGO bricks” - create experiments as easily as playing with LEGO
- Exclusive Discord channel where you can ask any question about quantum mechanics (also not covered in the course)

Policy:

- We offer a 100% refund if the course didn’t meet your expectations.
- Certificate upon finishing the course
- Fully on-line, all tools are in-browser
- Workshop formula - using our virtual Quantum Lab
- In English 


If you want to participate [sign up here](https://forms.gle/cfHgXTNwhuDkycgJA). 
There is only a limited number of places we can offer at this point on a “first come, first served” basis. The number of Early Bird places is limited.

## Meet the instructor
Piotr Migdał, one of the founders of Quantum Flytrap, obtained his PhD in quantum optics theory in ICFO (in 2012 top worldwide institute in physics, [as measured by high-impact papers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/08/07/83205/the-worlds-best-and-worst-scientific-institutions-ranked-by-discipline/)).
After finishing his doctoral studies, he became a consultant in machine learning & deep learning, giving workshops at companies such as Intel, Boston Consulting Group and Samsung Research.

His approach of simple, visual explanations attract people from diverse backgrounds. He succeeded in teaching [quantum mechanics for high-school students](https://p.migdal.pl/2016/08/15/quantum-mechanics-for-high-school-students.html) and AI for anyone with even a simple knowledge of Python ([Learning Deep Learning with Keras](https://p.migdal.pl/2017/04/30/teaching-deep-learning.html)).
