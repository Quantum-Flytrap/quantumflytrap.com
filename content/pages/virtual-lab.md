# Virtual Lab

The sandbox mode ([Virtual Lab by Quantum Flytrap](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com)) allows playing with quantum physics, replicating famous experiments (real and gedanken), creating new levels, designing quantum decorations, and simply having fun.


It is possible to create quantum computing algorithms ([Deutsch-Jozsa](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/deutsch-jozsa)), quantum cryptography protocols ([BB84](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/bb84) and [Ekert](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/ekert-bell)), advanced quantum measurements ([Elitzurâ€“Vaidman bomb tester](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/elitzur%E2%80%93vaidman-bomb) and [nonorthogonal state discrimination](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/nonorthogonal-state-discrimination)), historical interferometers ([Mach-Zehnder](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/mach-zehnder) and [Michaelson-Morley](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/michelson-morley)), classical optics ([three polarizers](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/three-polarizer-paradox) and [an optical diode](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/optical-diode)), and much more: [here are some user-created ones](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/u/)!

## Key features

Underneath there is s real simulator of quantum mechanics - a discrete variant describing polarization and discrete position. You may be not aware of unitary and projective operators, tensor products or complex number - but JavaScript & Rust is doing all the dark magic for you!

- Drag & drop elements to create a quantum experiment.
- Experience a real-time in-browser simulation.
- Interact with up to 3 entangled photons.
- Perform advanced quantum measurements (POVMs).
- See how the entanglement evolves with a visualization.
- Explore the multiverse tree of all possible outcomes.
- Check the exact quantum state with a ket visualizer.
- Use either physical elements or abstract qubit gates.
