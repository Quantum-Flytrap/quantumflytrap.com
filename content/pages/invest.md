Join the quantum revolution before your competition does.

## Description

Quantum Flytrap is an in-browser simulation & visualization of quantum mechanics. We aim to become the go-to place for learning quantum before the quantum computing revolution takes off.

Our first product is “quantum LEGO bricks” - an educational sandbox and a puzzle game. It can be used to set the first steps in the quantum world, teach at any level, and prototype new experiments.
