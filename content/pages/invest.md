Quantum physics not only sparks imagination but there also is a growing need for people from various fields to be able to harness its power.

The interest in quantum is growing fast but there is **a shortage of simple and engaging interactive tools** for education and research.
The current stage can be compared to using a pen & paper in computer science.

At Quantum Flytrap we make in-browser simulations & visualizations of quantum mechanics. We are building a go-to place for learning quantum before the quantum computing revolution takes off. With computing left to computers we offer ground-breaking tools for education and research.

Our first product - “quantum LEGO bricks” - is a virtual lab and (soon) a puzzle game. It can be used to set the first steps in the quantum world, teach at any level, and prototype new experiments.
