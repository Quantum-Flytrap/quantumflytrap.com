# cience Writer - quantum physics & iunteractive media

Quantum Flytrap is a startup on a mission to make quantum computing accessible technology. We develop a browser-based no-code IDE for quantum technologies. We are starting a project from a leading quantum device manufacturer - and we look to expand our team with a Frontend Developer!

The company was founded in 2020 by quantum physicist [Piotr Migdał](https://p.migdal.pl) and designer [Klem Jankiewicz](https://jankiewiczstudio.com/). Our tech demo, Virtual Lab, is already being used worldwide by Stanford and Oxford universities among others. Our team is distributed over Warsaw, Tel-Aviv, Wrocław, and Kraków. We have a small office in Warsaw - you can work from there if you like. For more details about us check out our website https://quantumflytrap.com/.
