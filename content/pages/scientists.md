## Virtual Lab for scientists

Virtual Lab is a virtual optical table. With a drag and drop interface, you can show phenomena, recreate existing experiments, and prototype new ones.

Within this environment it is possible to recreate interference, quantum cryptography protocols, to show entanglement, Bell test, quantum teleportation, and the many-worlds interpretation.

More details in our recent preprint [P. Migda≈Ç, K. Jankiewicz, P. Grabarz, et al. "Visualizing quantum mechanics in an interactive simulation - Virtual Lab by Quantum Flytrap", arXiv:2203.13300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13300).

## Key features

- Create arbitrary setup in a virtual optical lab
- Display of quantum state (so you can look up what happens, step by step)
- Dynamic change of basis
- Up to 3 entangled photons
- Many-worlds tree to show all possible outcomes at the same time
- Display of quantum operators, with their tensor structure

## For your classes

If you teach classical optics (polarization, optical activity, interference), quantum physics (superposition, entanglement), quantum information & cryptography (Bell inequality, BB84, Ekert protocol). From a simple level of a beamsplitter, to more advanced e.g. unambiguous discrimination of non-orthogonal states.

We prepared a few [classical setups](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/experiments). You are free to modify them, or make your own from the scratch.

## For your materials and slides

Our tools can be used in any quantum context, also outside of our Quantum Lab environment. For example: quantum chemistry, abstract quantum computing, energy levels, or even other modes of light (e.g. spatial degrees of freedom such as orbital angular momentum).

### Quantum Tensors

[Quantum Tensors](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/quantum-tensors) for quantum numerics (quantum computing, optics) inside interactive visualizations. It uses TypeScript (a dialect of JavaScript with types) so that can be used in any modern browser, without installation. It is supported by [Centre of Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore](https://www.quantumlah.org/).

For example, see [quantum computing example](https://jsfiddle.net/stared/wusev5a9/8/).
