_"The night is dark, with only a handful of photons."_

Tonight, we celebrate two things:

- The Winter Solstice (if you live in the Northern Hemisphere).
- The release of the Quantum Lab (alpha).

After months of hard work, we have a smooth simulation of up to 3 entangled photons, a rigorous quantum measurement, and a multiverse tree explorer. See [a short tutorial of the new features](/lab-how-to).

Psst - it is a long night. [Join our Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/2gfUArFd) for educators and researchers. The link is open only for this night.
